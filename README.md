# Project 1: Data Exploration - Population Growth (1950 to 2023)
# Overview
This project explores global population growth trends from 1950 to 2023. SQL was used to analyze key metrics, uncover trends, and compare growth rates across regions. The analysis helped derive valuable insights into population changes and their implications over time.

3 Steps Taken:
# Data Import:
Population data from 1950 to 2023 was imported.
Data was obtained from kaggle.com

# Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates.
Standardized column names and ensured data types matched the required format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed basic queries to explore growth trends.
Generated summary statistics and visualizations.

# SQL Queries and Analysis:
Aggregated population data by year and region.
Calculated annual growth rates using SQL functions.
Applied window functions for moving averages to smooth trends.

# Insights:
Identified regions with the highest and lowest population growth.
Highlighted periods of rapid growth and decline.
